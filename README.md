# Compiling

King's Epic game client makes use of [Go QML](https://github.com/go-qml/qml), so please ensure you can run some of the examples from that package before attempting to compile this client.

You will also need to [download the game art](http://kings-epic.com/downloads/art.zip).

# Server

In order to play the game, you will need to connect to a running server.  You will be able to download an early version of the server from [King's Epic](http://kings-epic.com), or if you own the game you can use your copy of the latest server version.  At the moment, the game is not available for purchase.

## Art

### Icons

Some of the icons were obtained from http://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/ifmie/i_made_700_rpg_icons_free_for_use_for_your_game/.  These are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.  These icons were made by Lorc.

### Other Art

You have permission to use them as part of the game client intended to connect to King's Epic game servers, but not for any other use (such as commercial) without explicit permission.

## Game Client

The client source code is licensed under the [GNU GPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

If you contribute any code to this project, you must agree to have that code licensed under the GNU GPL 3.0 license, but you must also grant permission to me to use that code as I see fit, including (but not limited to) using that code as part of a closed source version of the client, using that code in other projects, selling without sharing source code, and so on.  You must allow me to do these things without any charge or limitation.  Contributing code to this project will be taken as an agreement to these terms.

The primary purpose for this is so that I can produce a closed source version of the client should the need arise.  A secondary purpose is that it allows me to integrate that code into the server if required without releasing the source code.  I intend to include in the credits the name of anyone who contributes code to the project, should you wish to have your name included.

## Go-QML
